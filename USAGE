All the classes in the package main support these parameters. 

-DataDir DIR
	Use all txt files in DIR as data. The data files are organized such that 
	all instances corresponding to one class are listed in a single file 
	named with its label. Each line in the text file is treated as a
	single data instance. Put all unlabeled / test data in a file whose 
	name starts with "test". For a reference, check "data/movie" directory
	to see how the movie review data is organized.

-TrainModel TRUE|FALSE
	Indicates whether to train an RAE based on the data provided by the DIR
	directive. 
			
-ModelFile FILE
	This parameter is compulsory. FILE indicates the file into which the 
	trained RAE model is saved if TRAINMODEL is set to TRUE. If not, it 
	indicates the model file to be loaded to perform testing or feature 
	extraction.
	
-FeaturesOutputFile FILE
	This parameter is used only if not training. When not training, one of
	FeaturesOutputFile or ProbabilitiesOutputFile is compulsory. The system
	extracts features for the test data using the Model and saves it in FILE  
		
-ProbabilitiesOutputFile FILE
	This parameter is used only if not training. When not training, one of
	FeaturesOutputFile or ProbabilitiesOutputFile is compulsory. The system
	classifies the test instances and saves the probabilities of the item 
	belonging to each class into FILE. The classes are numbered 0 to K-1, 
	and indicates a class label. The ordering of the class labels is the
	alphabetical ordering of files in the -DataDir option. This will be 
	fixed in the next commit to list the labels themselves instead of the 
	label index. 
			
-NumCores NUMCORES
	Indicates how many parallel threads to use for feature processing. 
	Ideally it is the same as the number of cores on the machine but never
	more. If this field is not set, it automatically sets this value to
	the number of cores on the processor.

-NumFolds NUMFOLDS
	While doing a full demo run, indicates the number of folds to split 
	the data into. Ignored by all other interfaces.

-MaxIterations MAXITERATIONS
	The number of iterations for training the RAE. The default is 80.
			
-embeddingSize EMBEDDINGSIZE
	The RAE performs feature extraction by first embedding each word in
	the vocabulary into a high dimensional real space. Defaults to 50. 
	Higher values may result in severly increasing the training time.

-alphaCat ALPHA
	ALPHA is in [0,1] which indicates the balance between optimizing for
	classification loss against auto-encoder loss. In detail : feature 
	learning is performed by minimizing the reconstruction error. It is
	also possible to minimize for a classification loss which is indicates
	of how informative a single word is of the final class the sentence
	belongs to. Defaults to 0.2.

	For example, a word like "awesome" is highly indicative of a good 
	review. If your corpus is full of such words, increase the value of
	this parameter.
			
-Beta BETA
	BETA is in [0,1] and indicates the weight on the classification loss.
	Defaults to 0.5.
			
-lambdaW LAMBDAW
	All lambda are weights on the regularization terms. LambdaW is the weight
	on the embedding W1 - W4 (Refer the paper for more details)
			
-lambdaL LAMBDAL
	All lambda are weights on the regularization terms. LAMBDAL is the weight
	on the embedding We (Refer the paper for more details)
			
-lambdaCat
	All lambda are weights on the regularization terms. LAMBDACAT is the weight
	on the classifier weights.

-lambdaRAE
	All lambda are weights on the regularization terms. LAMBDARAE is the weight
	on the classifier weights. This differs from LAMBDACAT in that this is applied
	in the second phase where the RAE is being fine-tuned (Refer the paper for more
	details)

{"name":"JRAE","tagline":"I re-implemented a semi-supervised recursive autoencoder in java. I think it is a pretty nice technique. Check it out! Or fork it","body":"#Java Recursive Autoencoder\r\n\r\njrae is a re-implemention of semi-supervised recursive autoencoder in java. This package also contains code to demonstrate its usage. Stanford has an official code package integrated into Stanford CoreNLP, please check http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/code.html for updates.\r\n\r\nMore details are available at \r\n\r\nhttp://www.socher.org/index.php/Main/Semi-SupervisedRecursiveAutoencodersForPredictingSentimentDistributions\r\n\r\nIn short, semi-supervised recursive autoencoder is a feature learning algorithm to learn an encoding for text data and that can then be used for performing classification. The jrae package is pretty comprehensive - it includes code for learning the features as well as for performing basic classification, and is parallelized to run on a multi-core machine.\r\n\r\nThe package includes a demo of movie review classification on which the algorithm attains state-of-art results.\r\n\r\n#Dependencies\r\n\r\nThe RAE package requires the jblas package for supporting the linear algebra \r\noperations. These requirements are included in the lib directory.\r\n\r\n* jblas \r\n* junit4\r\n* log4j\r\n* jmatio\r\n\r\nIncluding the jblas jar file may not be sufficient. JBLAS requires either\r\nLAPACK or ATLAS. Check out https://github.com/mikiobraun/jblas if you run \r\ninto trouble. If you are running ubuntu, do `sudo apt-get install \r\nlibgfortran3`.\r\n\r\n#BUGS\r\n\r\nIf you encounter any bugs, please report it on github.\r\n\r\n* Author: Sanjeev Satheesh <ssanjeev@stanford.edu>\r\n* Created: 2012 February 20\r\n* Keywords: java, sentiment analysis, machine learning, nlp \r\n* URL: <http://github.com/sancha/jrae>\r\n\r\n#WORD2VEC\r\n\r\nThe core feature of the recursive autoencoder is to learn a representation of words and sentences. Google recently released a similar tool, you are encouraged to try out the word2vec project http://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ \r\n","google":"UA-22445063-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
